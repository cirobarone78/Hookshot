"""The launcher's profiles: each one is a user of the game with saves of its own, save/<id> in the game's user folder.
The Windows launcher keeps them the same way: builder/HookshotBuilder/Profiles.cs.

The game plays the profile HOOKSHOT_PROFILE=<id> names (host/nn_applet.c); without it, the default profile, the one user
every build had before profiles, so its saves stay where they were. The list is profiles.txt in the user folder, one
"<id> <name>" a line. An id is 32 hex digits, the save folder's name (host/nn_fs.c).

A profile's saves are imported from and exported to the emulators by scripts/oot_saves.py (docs/saves.md), with its
--hookshot naming the profile's save folder. Removing a profile moves its saves to save-backups/<id>-<time> in the user
folder: nothing is deleted.
