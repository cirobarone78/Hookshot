/* (hookshot) Item assignable buttons (the Insert menu's Controls tab): what the feature's two files share.
   host/oot_item_buttons.c has the controller filter, the item slot's answers, the game's hooks and the files the
   assignments are kept in; host/oot_item_buttons_hud.c shows the four items on the game's HUD.

   The game has one item slot, used with ZR, and a quick-switch menu on L and R. With the feature on, one of the two
   shoulder buttons is a hotkey the game no longer sees: held in play, A B X Y each use the item assigned to them; with the
   quick-switch menu open (the other shoulder button), or on the pause menu's Items page, hotkey + A B X Y assigns the item
   shown. Each save keeps its own items, in an item_buttons.ini in its slot's folder (save:/slot_NN/) that the game never
   reads: written when the game saves into that slot, read and checked against the save when it loads it.

   The hooks are nx2/oot_patches.py's (the supported build's lift only). Without them none of this runs and the filter
   passes every button through. */
