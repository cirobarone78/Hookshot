/* (hookshot) Item assignable buttons (the Insert menu's Controls tab, options 12 and 13): one shoulder button, the
   hotkey, is held to use the items put on A, B, X and Y, and in the game's quick-switch menu (the other shoulder
   button opens it) and on the pause menu's Items page hotkey + A B X Y puts the highlighted item on that button (the
   pause menu's pages then turn with ZL and ZR alone). host/oot_item_buttons.h has what the HUD's file
   (oot_item_buttons_hud.c) shares with this one.

   The game has one item slot, used with ZR (PouchMgr's AssignableItem, one per age). A face button's item is used by
   answering it for the slot to the player's own readers for a while and presenting ZR to the game in the face
   button's stead, so the press, the hold and the release are the game's own (a bow draws while the button is held and
   shoots when it is let go). Everything else that reads the slot (the HUD's ZR box, the menus, the pouch's
   bookkeeping) keeps seeing the saved one. The items are kept with each save, in an item_buttons.ini in its slot's
   folder that the game never reads: read when the game loads that slot, checked against the save once play starts,
   written when the game saves into a slot. An assignment changes them in memory only.

   The calls into here are nx2/oot_patches.py's (the supported build only) and one each in nn_hid.c and nn_fs.c:
   - hos_oot_ib_filter: each controller read (npad_states, the polling thread). The hotkey and the face buttons pressed
     under it are hidden from the game where the hotkey works, ZR is presented for a face button, and the presses
     become requests for the hooks below.
   - hos_oot_ib_save_file (nn_fs.c): each file the game opens. A slot's progress.sav read is a load of that slot,
     written a save into it (gmd::SaveDataMgr's thread).
   - hos_oot_ib_main, hos_oot_ib_leave: the Main sequence state's selector (f_83323ca0) and its commit to leave it
     (f_80f89630): play, where the hotkey works. There a save's items are checked once it has loaded, and a new game's
     emptied.
   - hos_oot_ib_player: Link's virtual keys (f_80594ab0), once a frame before his item selector: a use is started,
     followed and ended there, and whether its item is out (drawn, in hand: ZR is then that item's) is told.
   - hos_oot_ib_slot, hos_oot_ib_slot_set: PouchMgr::getAssignableItem (f_8019b6e0) and setAssignableItem (f_81231c00).
   - hos_oot_ib_screen: after every screen's update (Screen::calc, f_802f1380): the quick-switch menu here (assignments,
     the entries' glyphs and light blue, its key guide), the pause menu and the screen over it (assignments on the Items
     page, its slots' light blue and glyphs, the tab bar's glyphs, the key guide), the control guide (the hotkey's
     combo beside ZR while its item is out) and the title screen (a new game is play with no load since it came up),
     the HUD in oot_item_buttons_hud.c.
   - hos_oot_ib_decide, hos_oot_ib_bind: the quick-switch's decide (f_833e98f0) and the binding of its entries
     (f_833ea110).
   Without them nothing here runs, the filter passes every button through and no save's file is read or written.

   The hooks run on several of the game's threads (the sequence's, Link's worker, the UI's workers, the poll's, the
   saves'): what they share is atomic, or for the items under one lock held only to copy or change them (never over a
   file or a call into the game), and none waits for another otherwise (a busy try-lock skips that frame). */
