/* The game's data folder (hos_data.h): chosen once at the start, and the files a build from before kept loose in the game folder
   put where they go now.

   Which folder: --user <folder> when given; else, for a game started with nothing (as a player starts it: image.bin in the
   game folder), %LOCALAPPDATA%\Hookshot on Windows and $XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot (~/.local/share/hookshot) on Linux; else (a
   development run given its image.bin) "user" in the current folder, as before. A builder's folder whose platform folder cannot
   be made keeps <game>/user. A portable install (#2367's Builder: .hookshot_builder_home in the game folder) keeps its data
   folder in the game folder too, <game>/user, so it goes with the drive the game is on.

   What goes where:
   - the data folder: the saves and the settings (hookshot_options.ini, hookshot_env.txt), what belongs to the player;
   - <game>/cache: the shader and pipeline caches, made for this build and this GPU, several GB, beside the game the player put
     on the drive with room for it, and the button prompts made from the player's controls (cache/prompts: host/prompts.c).
     Its name says it can be deleted: the next start makes it again. One cache per game folder, so a release and a nightly
     side by side do not throw each other's away;
   - <game>/logs: hookshot_log.txt and the runs before it, and the other logs and traces a run writes.

   The move, each entry once and never over one already there:
   - for the platform folder only (a --user folder or a development run is the caller's to fill): the entries of <game>/user (the
     saves; on Linux since an earlier build already, on Windows now) into the data folder, a rename, else a copy and delete
     (another drive). All or nothing: when one of its entries is in the data folder already, or one cannot move (whatever moved is
     moved back), the saves stay in <game>/user, as they were, and nothing is lost or split (saves in both places are said in
     saves-in-two-places.txt, neither picked nor merged); the data folder is then <game>/user too, so that the settings stay with
     the saves (a second game folder beside the first keeps its own of both). A copy whose original cannot be deleted after (a file
     held or read-only) leaves <game>/user renamed user.moved, so that a later start does not take the leftover for the saves. A
     link (a symbolic link, a Windows junction) is never renamed or copied through: on Linux it is made again in the data folder,
     to the same folder (#2282); on Windows the saves stay with it. A user/ that is a link itself is the player's choice of place,
     used as it is. The settings, each on its own; one that cannot move stays, and the log says it is not read. For a portable
     install, the settings alone, into <game>/user;
   - whenever the game folder is known: its loose caches into cache/ and its logs into logs/ (renames on the same drive), the
     Vulkan pipeline cache renamed from mkw_vk_pipelines*.bin to hookshot_vk_pipelines*.bin on the way; the button prompts an
     older build made in the game folder's prompts/ (Common.*, External.bfotf.zs) are deleted: they are made again in cache/.
   language.txt is not moved: it is the build's, which the builder writes beside the game (nx2/make_game.py). */
