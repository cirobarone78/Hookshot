"""Compile and run the dGPU policy's rules (gpu/vk/dgpu_policy.h; no game/GPU required), and check that vk_memory.cpp
still wires them the way the policy states them: RX_VK_DGPU gates the whole policy (a pool's first binding makes no
mirror under it and marks it refused - in guest memory, nothing synced; unset, the policy costs nothing, not even its
counters), the refused pools' uniform buffers are copied as submitted (issue 1795's in-place hazard), the promotion
trials run one at a time on the frame's present-to-present time with binds counted on every serving path (the
mirror's included, so its work cannot read as drift), the A/B is voided only by a real scene or workload move and
three no-verdict endings sit a pool out, a verdict keeps a mirror only when the trial measured it faster by the
percent and the floor (whichever asks more), a loss is added to hookshot_mirror_skip.txt beside the game's own files
under a header naming the device and driver, and a candidate needs reads above the noise, not write-dominated, a
mirror that can come on, and a serial replay.
