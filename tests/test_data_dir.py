"""The data folder (host/hos_data.c): which folder a run keeps its saves and settings in, the game folder's cache/ and logs/,
and the one-time move of what a build from before kept loose in the game folder.

host/hos_data.c is built with the Linux stand-ins (host/posix/win32_posix.c) into a small program that prints the folder it
chose and the saves' folder. The program is copied into game folders built in a temporary folder, as the builder makes them
(image.bin beside it, or the game in bin/ beside image.bin), and run there:

- every run: the game folder's loose caches go into its cache/ (the play files by their prefix too) and its logs into its logs/;
- --user <folder> wins, and no setting or save moves; a run given its image.bin uses "user" in the current folder;
- a builder's folder uses $XDG_DATA_HOME/hookshot; the settings go there, the saves from <game>/user, and a note is left;
  language.txt (the builder's) stays, and the prompts made from the player's controls are deleted;
- a file already where it goes is not written over: the game folder's copy stays where it is;
- when a save entry cannot move (one of that name is there already, as for a second game folder beside the first), the
  saves stay in <game>/user together, and the data folder with them: the settings move there, not to the shared folder;
- a relative link in the saves, on the same drive, is never renamed into the data folder, where it would name nothing: it is
  made again there to the same folder (Linux; #2282, whose own cases tests/test_linux_saves_move.py runs on hos_data.c);
- saves in both places (a downgrade, then the upgrade again): this folder's are kept and used, nothing merged, and
  saves-in-two-places.txt says where both are and how to use the others;
- a settings file beside the game the game does not read is said in the log;
- a portable install (.hookshot_builder_home): the data folder is <game>/user, and nothing goes to the per-user folder;
- the game in bin/: the files come from the folder above it, the one with image.bin;
- across file systems (the data folder on another drive, where a rename fails: /dev/shm against /tmp here), the saves are
  copied and deleted; an entry that cannot be copied brings back the ones that went (all or none); a link is never copied
  through: it is made again in the data folder (Linux), and the folder it points to is untouched; an original that cannot be deleted after its
  copy leaves <game>/user renamed user.moved, so the next start keeps the data folder.
